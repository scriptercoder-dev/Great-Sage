"""Does Great Sage actually DO what it is told, or just talk about it?

Every entry here is a phrasing Krazaa has used or would plausibly use,
paired with the tool that must run. It exists because the failure mode is
not a crash - it is a confident refusal:

    "search on youtube for X"
    -> "I cannot directly play videos or execute external software for
        you. You will need to locate the video and press play manually."

The tools were attached to that turn and the model simply declined. So
the ones that matter are pre-routed - decided by this table rather than
by a 4B model's mood - and this file is what keeps that true. Run it
before shipping:

    py check_routing.py

MUST_NOT is as important as MUST. Pre-routing something that only sounds
like an instruction is worse than missing it: "how do I open a pull
request" must not launch an application, and "search my downloads folder"
belongs to the file tool, not DuckDuckGo.
