Great Sage - entry point.

This is the only file that knows how to translate config into a concrete
ModelProvider. Every other module works against the abstract ModelProvider
interface. To add a new provider later, add a branch here that builds it
(and set config.settings.ACTIVE_PROVIDER accordingly) - core/, ui/, and
models/base.py don't need to change.
