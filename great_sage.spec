#     appears, every single time.
#   * that temp folder is deleted on exit, so memory.txt, hud_settings.json
#     and the voice preferences would not survive a restart.
#
# What is NOT in here, because it cannot be:
#   * Ollama and its chat model - a separate service, installed system-wide.
#   * The F5/Whisper weights (~3.6GB) - fetched to the HuggingFace cache on
#     first use. Bundling them would roughly double the download for
#     something the app retrieves by itself.
